Code assembles, runs, and halts:   5/5
Main program contains a proper call to IS_BALANCED:  5/5
All registers that are modified by IS_BALANCED are restored to their original values on return:  0/5
All registers are properly initialized:   5/5
IS_BALANCED acquires input string from the keyboard until user hits ENTER key or when unbalanced sequence of brackets is encountered:  10/10
IS_BALANCED reads characters from the keyboard without using any TRAPs:  15/15
IS_BALANCED echoes input characters to the display without using any TRAPs:  15/15
IS_BALANCED uses stack subroutines PUSH and POP and implements the above algorithm:  25/25
On exit, IS_BALANCED returns result in R0:  5/5
Code uses as few as possible iterative and conditional constructs:   5/5
- well-structured
